			<h2>general information</h2>
			Description: The project will entail a hardware demonstration of some aspect of wireless communications. The detailed expectations will be discussed with each team in the proposal phase.  The results will be presented orally and in writing. A reasonable way of capturing the hardware results might be to use a video camera to record a demonstration. <br><br>

Oral presentation should be 12 minutes with an allowance of +/- 2 minutes per team member.  Each team member should speak for an equal amount of time. The written report should include at least 3 archival, peer-reviewed references. (A single book only counts once.)  The report should be sufficiently detailed to clearly explain the project results. The report should be formatted in two-column format according to the IEEE authors' instructions found here:
