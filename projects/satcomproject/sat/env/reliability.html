							<h2>The Motivation and Future Needs</h2>
							
							<p>
								The harsh space environment can wreak havoc on unprotected electronics. Exposure to energetic 
								particles can degrade device performance, ultimately leading to component failure over 
								time. Heavy ions, neutrons, and protons can scatter the atoms in a semiconductor 
								lattice, introducing noise and error sources.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								MooreÅfs Law means that circuit features have become smaller and run on less charge, 
								making them more vulnerable to disruption by incoming charged particles. It is a very 
								real issue for the latest densely packed terrestrial microprocessors &mdash; chip maker 
								Intel is investigating the concept of adding an on-chip cosmic ray detector to identify 
								radiation-based errors &mdash; so represents a more serious threat for components operating 
								beyond the protective umbrellas of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								These parts that are more rad hard are more expensive than their commercial counterparts 
								and have lagged several generations behind in terms of processing speed, power, and 
								size. In addition, many companies that were in the business of supplying rad-hard components 
								a decade ago have dropped out of the market.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								One strategy that has been gaining popularity in recent years is known as Radiation 
								Hardening by Design (RHBD), this approach relies solely on circuit design techniques 
								to mitigate the damage, functional upsets, and data loss caused by space radiation.
							</p>

									Figure E14: This graph charts the increasing speed of microprocessors versus year of 
									introduction for commercial products (the diamond plots) and rad-hard products 
									(the square plots). Because of the additional effort and cost associated with 
									developing radiation-hardened processes, the performance of space-qualified 
									electronics has typically lagged by 5 to 7 years behind their nonhardened 
									counterparts. <br/>

							<p>
								Satellites' radiation sensitivity has increased with reduced feature sizes. Not only is 
								there a concern with heavy ion-related effects but also increasingly with proton 
								effects. Proton-induced effects are particularly problematic due to their high fluxes 
								in Earth orbit. Passive electronic components and even straightforward wiring and 
								cabling can be seriously affected by radiation. The Aerospace Corporation is one of 
								the few companies left that has been investigating the means by which heavy ions, 
								protons, and electrons interact with microelectronics. This effort has helped spacecraft 
								designers find ways to prevent serious anomalies on orbit.

								ESA Ali Zadeh of the Components Space Evaluation and Radiation Effects Section said.<br/>
								Radiation effects of space radiation on satellite hardware are typically imperceptible 
								visually &mdash; although latch-ups cause visible damage, and optical materials and 
								solar arrays can darken over time ? but still have serious, even mission-ending, 
								consequences. This radiation can cause unpredictable spacecraft anomalies, and mission 
								success can depend on how well the onboard electronics resist its effects. Components 
								specifically designed to tolerate this environment are said to be "radiation hardened," 
								or simply "rad hard."

							<h2>Performance Implications</h2>
							<p>
								Design-hardened versions of integrated circuits require more space or circuitry than 
								their unhardened counterparts; therefore, overall performance will not be as good and 
								price will increase. Depending on the specific circuit function and the level of 
								hardness required, the area penalty may vary widely. Different mixes of Rad Hardening 
								By Design (RHBD) techniques can be used to provide elements with a range of hardness 
								levels. 
							</p>

								<p>
									Figure E17: A six-transistor latch, commonly used as the storage element in a static 
									memory circuit, is shown alongside a design-hardened 12-transistor variant 
									(Calin et al.). "B" and "BN" are the bit lines, used to input and output zeros and 
									ones to the memory cell. "W" represents the word line, used to activate the cell 
									and read out the stored information. In the conventional cell, a particle strike 
									directly into node Q may cause the latch to change state, resulting in an error. 
									In the design-hardened version, Q is represented at two different nodes. 
									Thus, a strike at any single node cannot cause an upset. 
									The number of transistors per latch has doubled, which can significantly reduce 
									the available gate count in a given circuit area.<br />

							<p>
								For example, a design-hardened chip using two-, three-, or four-input logic gates with 
								edgeless transistors and guard bands might be several times bigger than a commercial 
								version of the chip. The resulting capacitance increase would cause an increase in 
								power consumption and a reduction in circuit speed, compared with a commercial 
								design using the same technology. 
							</p>

						<div class="post">
							<h2>Reliability</h2>
							
							<p>
								The shrinking of commercial CMOS technologies has proceeded faster than reductions in 
								supply voltages and the result is higher electric fields increasing the reliability 
								problems associated with advanced CMOS. Various approaches can help mitigate the 
								reduced reliability of advanced CMOS technologies. An example, the power-supply 
								voltages can be lowered to reduce internal electric fields in a given circuit.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The use of Rad Hardening By Design (RHBD) techniques offers even more options. 
								For example, the length of critical transistor gates can be increased to reduce electric 
								fields and prolong service life. However, because these longer transistors are slower 
								than the minimum-size transistors, the increase in reliability comes at the expense of 
								speed. 
							</p>
							
						</div>
						<div id="pager"></div>
						
						
						<div class="post">
							<h2>Future Issues</h2>
							
							<p>
								The RHBD approach must demonstrate its ability to consistently and reliably supply a 
								full range of rad-hard parts before it will be accepted as a viable alternative to the 
								dedicated foundry approach. The Aerospace Corporation is working with the relevant 
								government agencies to create and maintain a coordinated RHBD infrastructure to 
								address all the relevant issues and could be a prime supplier of rad hard electronics 
								to a space solar power generating space satellite.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								For example, circuit designers use computer-aided design tools to define and verify 
								the final circuit layout, to perform logical simulation of the design, to identify 
								potential failure modes, and to perform static and dynamic timing simulations. These 
								tools use so-called "cell libraries" to simplify the design process as much as possible. 
								Each library is a collection of individual circuit elements that includes functional and 
								performance information about each element. Effective use of RHBD requires that 
								knowledge of the behavior of the circuits in the space environment be incorporated into 
								the computer-aided design tools. For instance, the programs would need to simulate the 
								electrical behavior of the transistor switch in a radiation environment based on the 
								structure of the device and the physics of the radiation interactions. Since many of 
								these tools are currently limit they would have to be added to and updated for such a 
								large scale project.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Funding for libraries with the most stringent requirements&mdash;and thus the smallest 
								markets&mdash;must be generated by the customer community, most likely the Department 
								of Defense (DOD) which could be in cooperation with the project to reduce cost. 
								Commercial foundries typically provide the starting material for all electronic 
								components manufactured in their processing facilities; however, nonstandard starting 
								materials incorporating epitaxial layers or insulating substrates, for example, 
								may enhance radiation immunity but would also include extra cost compared to the 
								original commercial products.

									Table E1: Relative performance parameters for a hypothetical 100,000-gate logic circuit 
									(without latches) in unhardened, foundry-hardened, and design-hardened versions is 
									compared to rad hard by design and other commercial approaches. Using a two-input 
									logic gate along with edgeless transistors and guard bands, the design-hardened 
									version (hardened only against total-dose effects) requires 3.2 times more chip area, 
									runs 8 percent slower, and dissipates 3.2 times as much power at constant speed than 
									the commercial version. However, when compared with the same circuit from a typical 
									rad-hard foundry, which is assumed to be two generations behind the commercial process, 
									the design-hardened version requires 29 percent less area, runs 6 times faster, and 
									consumes 30 percent less power at constant speed. <br />

								Government agencies, corporations, and universities around the world are presently 
								researching and developing RHBD techniques. The Air Force Research Laboratory is 
								funding several such projects, including some geared toward developing rad-hard 
								digital and mixed-signal circuits. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is similarly 
								funding various RHBD efforts, including programs to develop a radiation-tolerant 
								static-memory chip using a commercial foundry, a radiation-hardened readout 
								integrated circuit using both traditional rad-hard foundry processing and RHBD 
								techniques, and a submicron-level chip incorporating RHBD features. The agency is 
								also developing an integrated, foundry-independent rad-hard digital design center 
								and has a program to develop and demonstrate an analog standard cell library. 
								Sandia National Laboratories also is involved in radiation harden electronics and 
								has the facilities to test results due to radiation. 
								DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has recently announced a 
								major program to develop digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits in highly 
								advanced commercial technologies using RHBD techniques.

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>
								Radiation hardness by design has quickly evolved from future hope to a business 
								strategy that may well redefine the way electronic components are procured for 
								defense space systems and would be important to incorporate the design into the 
								project. The Aerospace Corporation and others have demonstrated that RHBD 
								techniques can provide immunity from total-dose and single-event effects in 
								commercially produced circuits. CAD tools that can model these radiation effects 
								and cell libraries that use a range of these techniques have been developed at a 
								number of government agencies, universities, and private companies during the 
								past several years, culminating in the commercial production of RHBD memories, 
								microprocessors, and application-specific integrated circuits that are being 
								specified in DOD and NASA missions. The infrastructure needed to make RHBD a 
								mainstream procurement approach is gradually being developed and could greatly 
								be expanded to support the space solar powered mission.

							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>
								Understanding how space radiation interacts with microelectronics is the first step 
								in establishing ways to mitigate adverse effects. Research at The Aerospace Corporation 
								and Government Agencies has been instrumental in revealing the underlying mechanisms 
								that lead to radiation-induced effects. Semiconductor manufacturing processes continue 
								to evolve, and new technologies present new opportunities for complex interactions.
