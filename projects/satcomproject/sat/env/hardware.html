							<h2>Major Concerns</h2>
							<p>
								Two types of space radiation are of particular concern for spacecraft electronics designers. The first, 
								known as the total ionizing dose, represents the cumulative effect of many ionized particles hitting a 
								device throughout the course of its mission life, slowly degrading the device until it ultimately fails. 
								The second involves high-energy particles that penetrate deep into materials and components, leaving a 
								temporary trail of free charge carriers in their path. If these particles hit sensitive nodes in the circuit, 
								they can produce adverse effects, generically described as "single-event effects."
							</p>
							<p>
								One type of electronic component often found aboard a satellite is the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor 
								(CMOS) integrated circuit. CMOS devices use the simultaneous flow of both electron and hole currents through 
								transistors and logic gates. The transistors that carry these negative and positive currents need to be 
								isolated from each other; this is where space radiation can interfere.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Total Dose Effects</h2>
							<p>
								Total dose refers to the integrated radiation dose that is accrued by satellite electronics over a certain 
								period of time, usually over a 1 year period, or over the satellite mission lifetime. The radiation has the 
								capability to damage materials due to its ability to ionize material. The energetic ions then can cause 
								damage to materials by breaking and/or rearranging atomic bonds. After exposure to sufficient total-dose 
								radiation, most insulating materials such as capacitor dielectrics, circuit-board materials, and cabling 
								insulators become less insulating or become more electrically leaky. Certain conductive materials, such as 
								metal-film resistors, can change their characteristics under exposure to total-dose radiation. Semiconductor 
								devices in particular exhibit a number of effects. It is important to choose materials and components for 
								satellite electronics that have the necessary radiation tolerance for the required mission. It is also 
								necessary to design in margins or allowances for the expected component changes induced by the radiation 
								environment.
							</p>

							<div style="color: #48DAC1;">
								<p>
									Figure E8: Charge buildup affects the current-voltage characteristics of the 
									transistors used in semiconductor circuits. Proper operation of a transistor relies on the ability to 
									switch it from a low-conductance (off) state to a high-conductance (on) state as the gate voltage passes 
									through a threshold. Extended exposure to radiation can shift the threshold voltages (top image), making the transistors easier or harder to switch. Radiation may also increase the leakage current (bottom image), causing the on and off states of the transistors to become less distinguishable. Either effect can ultimately cause circuit failure.
								</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								As commercial CMOS processes have advanced, the inherent radiation resistance of these devices has improved&#8212;and 
								thus, the Rad Harden By Design (RHBD) approach has become possible. The current that flows through CMOS 
								transistors is governed by a low-voltage gate over each device, isolated by a layer of oxide. These insulating 
								layers can develop a charge after long exposure to ionizing radiation, and this charge can affect the flow of 
								current through the device; but as circuits have shrunk, the thicknesses of these insulating layers have 
								decreased, presenting less opportunity for charge buildup.
							</p>
							<p>
								More problematic are the radiation-induced increases in leakage current&#8212;that is unregulated current flowing 
								across unintended areas of the semiconductor. When leakage current bypasses the transistor's isolated regions, 
								it degrades the distinguishability of the transistor's "on" and "off" states. Leakage also increases the 
								circuit's background current, or the amount of current flowing when the device is in a quiescent state. 
								Such an increase, multiplied by the tens of millions of switches in each circuit, can drive up power 
								consumption, increasing heat-dissipation needs and prematurely draining the power source of the satellite. 
								In an extreme case, the isolation between discrete components can also be lost, rendering the circuit useless.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								First the gate oxide becomes ionized by the dose it absorbs. The free electrons and holes drift under the 
								influence of the electric field that is induced in the oxide by the gate voltage. These holes and electrons 
								would be fairly benign if they were to simply able to drift out of the oxide, but although the electrons are 
								fairly mobile, the holes are not. A small fraction of them become trapped in the gate oxide. After sufficient 
								radiation dose, a large positive charge builds up on this gate oxide, having the same effect as if a positive 
								voltage were applied to the gate. With enough total dose, the device turns on even if no control voltage is 
								applied. The transistor source-drain current can no longer be controlled by the gate and remains on permanently. 
								PMOS transistor experiences a similar but opposite condition where the state is trapped in a continuous off 
								state. The &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states in the digital world are &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221; and with accumulated dose will cease to 
								function.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								A similar effect can occur in a single transistor. Trapped charges in the field oxide form a leakage path along 
								the edges parallel to normal conduction flow in an NMOS transistor. The silicon along these edges forms an 
								unwanted conduction path. In modern CMOS devices, edge leakage is frequently the dominant mode limiting the 
								total-dose hardness of the product. After a high total dose, the transistors cumulatively leak so much current 
								that the power supply can no longer handle the load. The power dissipation rises to high levels, and the chip 
								fails. A hardened field oxide is usually required to help prevent this occurrence.
							</p>

									ultimately leading to failure.

								</div>
							</center>

							<p>
								The Aerospace Corporation has been testing the total-dose hardness of various commercially available CMOS 
								manufacturing processes since 1995 by building test devices and irradiating them in a cobalt-60 radiation 
								chamber. For example, The Aerospace Corporation and other companies have shown that total-dose effects can 
								be mitigated by designing transistors in an enclosed shape, thereby eliminating the edges that can trigger 
								current leakage along the borders of conventional transistors. Current flows from the center to the outside 
								of these devices, making them immune to edge leakage current, but requiring a larger area for each transistor. 
								Many commercial products lacking a hardened gate oxide (such as the processors used in desktop computers) 
								might last a few days or weeks in a satellite orbit so this process would greatly benefit any space mission 
								in orbit around earth.

							<h2>Single-Event Effects</h2>
							
							<p>
								Highly energetic ions such as cosmic rays can easily penetrate the structure of a spacecraft, pass through 
								internal components, and exit the structure in a straight line. This single particle impact is often called 
								a single-event effect. Shielding against them is simply not practical because of the ability for these 
								particles to penetrate material. Because the heavy particles are omnidirectional, they impinge on an integrated 
								circuit at random times and locations, with random angles of incidence.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The concept of total ionizing dose is not useful to describe a single particle; instead, a quantity called the 
								linear energy transfer is used. As the particle traverses the material of interest, it deposits energy along 
								its path. Linear energy transfer is the amount of energy deposited per unit of distance traveled, normalized 
								to the material's density. It is usually expressed in MeV-cm2/mg. A typical satellite environment will include 
								a wide variety of particles with various amounts of kinetic energy corresponding to a wide spectrum of linear 
								energy transfer.
							<p>
							
							<p>
								An energetic ion passes through a semiconductor device in a few picoseconds. As it does so, it leaves behind a 
								"track" or column of ionized material typically ranging from a few tenths of a micron to a few microns in 
								diameter. The ionized track contains equal numbers of electrons and holes and is therefore electrically neutral. 
								The total number of charges is proportional to the linear energy transfer of the incoming particle. It is as if 
								a conducting wire were suddenly inserted into the semiconductor device, disturbing the electric fields and 
								normal current paths.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								If a cosmic ray passes through the drain region of an NMOS transistor, a short is momentarily created between 
								the substrate (normally grounded) and the drain terminal (normally connected to a positive power supply voltage). 
								If this happens, a spike of current flows for an instant at the event site. The amount of charge that is 
								"collected" from the ion track before it dissipates or disappears by recombination is significant: Every 
								device has a certain critical charge, which, if exceeded, results in a single-event upset, burnout, or other 
								undesirable phenomenon.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The process of energetic-ion-induced charge collection is complex and rapid, and is not completely understood. 
								It consists in part of charge "funneling," where distortion of the normal electric field patterns of a device 
								allows more charge to be collected than could normally be transported into the sensitive region. Charges are 
								also pulled away from the drain-substrate junction by diffusion. The ability of a device to collect charge 
								from the ion track determines its sensitivity to cosmic rays.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								If a device is large, it presents a greater target for cosmic rays. It is therefore more likely to receive a 
								"hit" than a smaller device. In determining the sensitivity of a device to single-event effects, two important 
								parameters to consider are the threshold linear energy transfer, above which upsets or single events are seen, 
								and the saturation cross section. Researchers have identified various types of single-event effects, varying in 
								their degree of seriousness.
							</p>
							
							<center>
								<img class="nocaption" src="./res/FigureE11.gif" />
								<div style="color: #48DAC1;">
								<p>
									Figure E11: Latchup occurs when the source of one MOS transistor forges a pathway to the drain of another. A transient 
									radiation pulse can generate the current needed to bridge this gap. Current will then continue to flow 
									unregulated between the two components. The entire circuit must be powered down to break the connection. 
									In some cases, the circuit may be permanently damaged.
								</p>
								</div>
							</center>
							
							
							<p>
								A single-event transient, for example, is a temporary spike or signal caused by a heavy ion. In some cases, 
								this spike can excite analog circuits into temporary or permanent oscillation. In digital circuits, the spike 
								may propagate through many logic gates, causing system malfunction. In mixed-signal devices, a transient 
								generated in the analog part of the device can propagate into the digital part, causing logic-level shifts.<br /><br />
								A single-event upset usually manifests itself as a "bit-flip" or change of state in a logic circuit. If enough 
								of these upsets occur, or if a single critical node is affected, a computer can freeze up and must be rebooted. 
								Single-event upsets occur in computer memories, microprocessors, controllers, and almost any digital circuit 
								containing latches or memory elements.
							</p>

							<p>
								Single-event latchup is triggered when a heavy ion causes current to flow unregulated between components on 
								an integrated circuit. When PMOS and NMOS transistors are integrated into the same area of a silicon substrate, 
								they can form a parasitic or undesired circuit element (called a thyristor) if struck by an energetic ion. A 
								thyristor is an interconnected n-p-n and p-n-p bipolar transistor; the current amplified by the n-p-n transistor 
								supplies the p-n-p transistor, which in turn supplies it back to the n-p-n transistor, creating a feedback loop. 
								When an energetic particle traverses the region of a CMOS integrated circuit containing the parasitic 
								transistors, it can generate enough current to trigger the thyristor, if this happens the effected portion of 
								the CMOS integrated circuit will be driven into what is called &#8220;latchup.&#8221;
							</p>

							<center>
								<img class="nocaption" src="./res/FigureE12.gif" />
								<div style="color: #48DAC1;">
								<p>
									Figure E12: Current is generated in a p-n junction exposed to transient radiation. It can be modeled as a 
									transient current source in parallel with a diode.
								</p>
								</div>
							</center>
							
							<p>
								As long as the power supply maintains the voltage equal to or greater than the thyristor "holding" voltage, 
								the latchup condition remains. The entire integrated circuit must be powered down to correct the condition. 
								In many cases, the current is sufficient to burn out the transistors or metallization in the latchup path, 
								permanently damaging the circuit (a phenomenon known as single-event burnout). The outcome depends on the 
								circuit design, the geometry, and the presence of any current-limiting resistances. This serious problem makes 
								it very difficult to use most commercial integrated circuits in an environment where heavy-particle radiation 
								may be encountered. Bipolar integrated circuits are particularly sensitive to latchup.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Other single-event phenomena are even more complex. For example, in certain MOS transistors, the gate oxide 
								can be ruptured by the passage of a cosmic ray. While not completely understood, this so-called single-event 
								gate rupture may be caused by a combination of charge-multiplicative breakdown and injection of charges into 
								the gate oxide.

							<h2>Neutron or Proton Damage</h2>
							
							<p>
								When highly energetic neutrons or protons penetrate the crystal lattice of a semiconductor, such as silicon, 
								atoms can get displaced through several mechanisms. For example, the incident particle can transfer some of 
								its energy to the silicon nucleus, and if enough energy is transferred (approximately 25 electron volts), the 
								nucleus gets knocked out of position. This is called elastic scattering, and the freed silicon atom can lose 
								energy through ionization or by displacing other atoms. Inelastic scattering can also occur, where the struck 
								nucleus absorbs the neutron or proton and then reemits it at a lower energy along with a gamma ray. The 
								displacements caused by this process are essentially microscopic crystal imperfections that interfere with the 
								orderly flow of charges from the source to the drain.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The resulting crystal lattice contains voids where the silicon atoms were knocked out of position and clusters 
								where they came to rest. These sites, known as traps or recombination centers, respectively, can be a source of 
								problems in some semiconductor devices. For example, a bipolar-junction transistor functions as a current 
								amplifier. A p-n junction is the place where a p-type material meets an n-type material. There are two types of 
								bipolar-junction transistors&#8212;n-p-n and p-n-p&#8212;which are created by sandwiching semiconductor of one 
								doping type between two other layers of the opposite type.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The principle of operation of bipolar transistors is by charge-carrier diffusion, which is different from the 
								MOS transistor, whose principle of operation is by drift. In an n-p-n bipolar transistor, electrons are emitted 
								by the emitter n-type layer into a middle material known as the base, where they diffuse to the collector n-type 
								layer at the opposite side. If the transistor were perfect, all the electrons that traverse the middle material 
								would be collected. In actuality, some are lost through recombination with holes. The transistor gain is 
								therefore defined as the amount of current that reaches the collector compared with the amount that recombines 
								with the base.
							</p>
							
							
							
							<center><div class="figure">
								<a href="./res/FigureE13.gif" rel=lightbox title="Figure E13">
								<img class="figure" src="./res/FigureE13.gif" /></a>
								</div>
								<div style="color: #48DAC1;">
								<p>
									Figure E13: Operation of a bipolar junction transistor. Electrons are emitted at one end, diffuse through the 
									middle material (the base), and are eventually collected. If the transistor were perfect, all the emitted 
									electrons would be collected; however, some are lost through recombination with holes in the base.
								</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								When the transistor is exposed to neutrons or protons, displacement damage and new recombination centers are 
								created. This increases the likelihood that electrons will recombine with holes in the base material. Higher 
								neutron or proton fluxes give rise to higher rates of recombination and lower transistor gain. Eventually, 
								the transistor fails because its gain drops too low to provide amplification. This is the dominant failure 
								mode in bipolar integrated circuits.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Bipolar-junction transistors are also sensitive to total ionizing dose. The phenomenon is similar to that 
								observed in MOS transistors, where an unwanted conducting channel is formed adjacent to the surfaces of the 
								field oxide. These channels cause unwanted current that can eventually cause device failure. Similarly, MOS 
								transistors are somewhat sensitive to displacement damage. Some of the charges are scattered by the damage 
								sites, and the transistors exhibit a loss of conductance and an increase in noise. These degradations are 
								themselves capable of causing circuit failures.
