							<p>
								Solar and cosmic radiation high-energy particles, belts of protons, electrons and 
								ions collected within Earth's magnetic field is a hazard to satellites and their 
								hardware.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The Apollo missions exposed the astronauts to this radiation because the lunar orbit 
								took them outside the earth's geomagnetic shield.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								This radiation is relatively uncommon within Earth's atmosphere and therefore many 
								commercial off the shelve parts manufacture do not account for these sources in earth 
								designs. The regions that satellites encounter radiation areas include the Van Allen 
								belts, cosmic rays, neutrons, and other subatomic particles created in high-energy 
								collisions of primary particles with spacecraft materials. The space environment 
								also changes with time, often in unpredictable and undiscovered ways, making it a 
								challenge to completely assess the hazards in any orbit.
							</p>

								<p>Figure E3. Earth's magnetosphere is a teardrop-shaped cavity formed by the 
									interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind becomes 
									subsonic at the bow shock. The magnetosphere contains the Van Allen radiation 
									belts (NASA)</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								Typical satellite orbits cross many of these regions and spend a variable amounts 
								of time in each. The unit of kinetic energy for these particles is the electron volt. 
								At high energies (millions of electron volts), these particles have sufficient energy 
								to ionize atoms in materials through which they propagate. At lower energies 
								(below thousands of electron volts) their effects range from charge accumulation on 
								surfaces to material degradation. The interaction of space particles with spacecraft 
								materials and electronics is complex to describe and difficult to simulate with 
								ground-based test facilities.

							<h2>Interplanetary Space and Galactic Cosmic Rays</h2>
							<p>
								The sun and most planets in the solar system generate magnetic fields and these contain 
								its own population of particles and radiation. Several satellites near Earth 
								continuously monitor the intensity of the particles and electromagnetic fields in 
								interplanetary space. Space satellites that monitor this radiation have determined 
								that the radiation is highly variable, but the consistent locations of intensities 
								occur in the planetary magnetospheres.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The space between the planets is not a vacuum, but at about 10 particles per cubic 
								centimeter, the particle density is many orders of magnitude below typical densities 
								of materials found on Earth. For radiation effects it is not only the particle density, 
								but also how the energy is distributed among the particles that determines their 
								hardness to space missions. Measurements have shown a tremendous range in both 
								particle intensity and energy, with fewer and fewer particles at higher and higher 
								energies.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Galactic cosmic rays have the highest-energy particles in the solar system. 
								They originate outside the solar system (possibly in supernova shocks) and probably 
								represent the accumulated output of many particle sources and acceleration processes. 
								Always Their considerations consist of about 87 percent protons, 12 percent helium 
								nuclei, and 1 percent heavier ions.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The sun is ejects disturbances into interplanetary space and as these disturbances 
								propagate, they carry tangled magnetic fields that scatter the lowest-energy 
								galactic particles. The galactic particle intensity at Earth varies inversely with 
								the solar cycle (it also varies with radial distance from the sun and latitude 
								above the ecliptic plane, although these effects are small compared to the solar 
								cycle variations).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="pager"></div>
						
						
						
						<div class="post">
							<h2>Solar Wind amd Solar Energetic Particles</h2>
							<p>
								Most of the particles in interplanetary space are in the form of a hot, ionized gas 
								called the solar wind. It is ejected radially from the sun with a speed at Earth that 
								varies from about 300 to 1000 kilometers per second. This represents a mass loss of 
								about 1014 kilograms per day. X-ray images of the solar atmosphere at low altitudes 
								show regions of varying intensity and therefore varying particle winds. The brightest 
								and hottest regions, with temperatures at several million degrees, lie above sunspots. 
								The darker areas are coronal holes large, cooler volumes of the atmosphere filled with 
								magnetic field lines that extend into interplanetary space. In the coronal holes, 
								the solar wind travels about twice as fast as it does from regions on the sun with 
								magnetic fields that loop back to the surface.
							</p>

								<p>Figure E4. Diagram of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts and the trap 
									charges due to magnetic field of earth.</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								Explosive ejections of large volumes of the solar atmosphere, known as coronal mass 
								ejections, draw out complex loops of magnetic field into interplanetary space. The 
								magnetic field's direction and strength determine how energy from the solar wind gets 
								transferred into the planetary magnetospheres. Many highly variable sources produce 
								interplanetary particles with energies typically between 10 thousand and 100 million 
								electron volts.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								While these energy releases are generally called "proton events." Protons are the most 
								abundant ions produced, these events also energize ions as heavy as iron. Both the 
								protons and the heavy ions are hazardous to spacecraft: The more abundant protons are 
								primarily responsible for anomalies resulting from the total radiation dose, while 
								heavy ions contribute most to anomalies known as single-event effects.

							<h2>Earth's Magnetosphere and the Van Allen Belts</h2>
							<p>
								Earth's magnetic field establishes a volume of space within which the magnetic field 
								dominates charged particle motion. Close to Earth, the magnetic field is roughly a 
								magnetic dipole that is tilted 11.5 degrees from the rotational axis andfor most 
								purposes, the dipole approximation is poor.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The magnetosphere is complex and dynamic because of its interaction with the variable 
								solar wind and transient phenomena from the sun. The sunward dimension can change by 
								more than a factor of two depending on the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind 
								upstream from Earth. The magnetosphere contains a mixture of plasmas with incredibly 
								diverse sources. The magnetosphere has its own weather, with complex processes of 
								particle transport and acceleration during geomagnetic storms that contribute to 
								surface charging and internal charging of spacecraft. 
							</p>
							
							<center><div class="figure">
								<a href="./res/FigureE5.gif" rel="lightbox" 
									title="Figure E5">
								<img class="figure" src="./res/FigureE5.gif" /></a>
								<p>Figure E5. Influenced by Earth's magnetic field, charged particles engage in a 
									complex dance of motions as each one spirals around a magnetic field line, bounces 
									back and forth between the hemispheres, and drifts around the planetelectrons to the 
									east, and protons to the west.</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								A charged particle in a constant magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to 
								its motion. The resulting trajectories of ions and electrons in the magnetosphere are 
								a complex superposition of motions as each particle travels in a spiral around a 
								magnetic field line, bounces back and forth between the North and South Poles, and 
								drifts around the planet, with electrons drifting east and protons drifting west.
							</p>

							<p>
								As these particles are trapped on time scales ranging from days to years, they execute 
								their gyration, bounce, and drift motions around Earth, resulting in spatial zones of 
								trapped radiation known as the Van Allen belts. The inner zone is the proton belt 
								(peak intensity at about 3000 kilometers from Earth's surface) and the outer zone the 
								electron belt (peak intensity from about 12,000 to 22,000 kilometers from the surface).
							</p>
							
							<p>
								There are trapped electrons and protons throughout the magnetosphere. Also, the 
								particles that contribute most to the radiation dose in the inner zone are protons 
								and those contributing most in the outer zone are electrons. Occasionally, new radiation 
								belts form between the inner and outer zones when interplanetary shock waves from 
								coronal mass ejections hit the magnetosphere. The inner zone is the relative stability 
								zon which results from a combination of long particle lifetimes in this part of the 
								magnetic field and the slowly varying cosmic ray input.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								All spacecraft in low Earth orbit penetrate the inner zone in the South Atlantic Anomaly 
								even if their altitude is below the belt at other positions in the orbit. While relative 
								stability is one key property of the inner zone, variability is the outstanding 
								characteristic of the outer radiation belt. This is important because as seen in 
								Figure E5 depending on the orbit of a satleite will determine how much and what kind 
								of radiation a satellite will see.

							<h2>Examples of Current Research and Plasma Effects on Surfaces of satellites</h2>
							<p>
								Several factors continually press the need for a better specification and understanding 
								of the space environment. One is the increase in spacecraft lifetimes, leading to 
								questions about longer-term exposures than have been tested in the past. Another is the 
								growing interest in uncommon orbits, where the residence time in different hazard areas 
								is unlike what has been experienced. A third is the use of new materials, which need to 
								be assessed for suitability in space. Aerospace has been conducting research to address 
								the concerns raised by these and other issues. This will become more important factor 
								as the need for satellite lifetimes to increase to keep them profitable longer.

									outer radiation belts. (Air Force Research Laboratory)</p>
							</div></center>
							
							<p>
								Space plasmas can change the physical properties of exposed surfaces. For example, 
								optical coatings are used to increase the efficiency of solar arrays; their performance 
								depends in part on their transmittance, which can change after a long exposure to the 
								space plasma environment. Aerospace is beginning to derive preliminary specifications 
								of the low-energy plasmas around Earth based on data from previous and active science 
								missions.

							<h2>Extreme Value Analysis</h2>
							<p>
								The highest intensity of outer-belt electrons in the past 16 years occurred in a 
								geomagnetic storm on March 28, 1991. One question important for space systems design 
								is whether a similar or more intense event will occur during a future mission. 
								Aerospace has used mathematical tools such as statistics of extreme events to help 
								answer this question. The analysis indicates that the March 1991 event was equivalent 
								to a 20-year storm. The analysis also suggests that a 100-year storm could be about 
								twice as intense. This mathematical approach does not predict when such events will 
								occur, but it has potential to specify the extreme environment, thereby satisfying 
								an important engineering requirement.
