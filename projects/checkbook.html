			<h2>general information</h2>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a project I began out of the need for a digial form of a checkbook register back in December of 2009. A digital form would be most convienient since all of my accounts offer a comma-separated value file list of all of my transactions. The goal was to create a database manager that could both read in transactions and save them to files in the database as well as read in the transactions that were previously stored.<br><br> 
			The application performs all of these desired functions, but leaves much to be desired by the user. I have decided that due to the sparse knowledge base for Visual C++ and my having gained an extensive amount of experience with C# that any further developments should entail porting the program over to C#. Below is a screen shot of the application and the executable and readme file. <br><br>
			Language: Visual C++ <br><br>
			Version: 0.7.0<br><br>
			Last Update: 09/14/2012<br><br>
