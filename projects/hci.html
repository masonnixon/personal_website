			<h2>general information</h2>
			Description: This course will teach you about the importance of the human-computer interface in the design and development of things people use. We will touch on many of the perceptual, cognitive, and social characteristics of people, as well as methods for learning more about the people you wish to use your systems (analyzing the tasks they perform, the way they perform them, the way they think and feel about what they do, etc.). We will discuss the capabilities and limits of computers and other related systems, and discuss how that affects design and implementation decisions.<br><br>

We will also cover methods of design, and ways to implement, evaluate, and improve a design. The course will be a blend of perceptual/psychological, social, design, and computer science elements. You will work on individual and group projects to learn in a hands-on way about the various stages of an effective design process. <br><br>
